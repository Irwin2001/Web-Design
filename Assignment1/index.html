<h2>A Short Summary</h2>

<h3> A Man Out Of Time </h3>
 <p> Alric was once a hero, but now lives in the distant future. 
  He's a man out of time, in a era that no longer needs savoirs. 
  He still holds onto the values of hope, faith, and compassion in 
  a society that grown numb and sterile.
  He is haunted by his own grief of his family, friends, and lost time. 
  Alric navigates a disconnected world, struggling to find meaning.
  This is a story about living between what was and what is, 
  about being good when goodness feel forgotten, and about a quiet man trying
  to heal in a world that moved on without him. 
</p>

<h3> My Current Thoughts</h3>
  <li>I want Alric to be a flat character in a world that challege him and his ideals.</li> 
  <li>Alric struggles to believe if he can even help other</li>
  <li>He has personal and deep sorrow</li>
  <li>He shows small acts of kindness for other</li>
  <li>He shows that goodness still has power</li>
  <li>He will accpet the world has move on, but his values remain the same</li>
