DC fan Society Final Project Reflection
 What are you most proud of in your final project?
    I think the most proud of this project was turning a simple multi-page website into something that feels like a real fan club website or starter one to be more accurate.
 What would you add or refine in the future?
    I would try to refine the club aspect by adding a contact form or sign-up or even a real discord link then a place holder one day. I’d also like to explore adding user-submitted content or a blog area where members could share reviews or art like reddit or any blog site has. Visually, I’d want to add animation or better transitions that help capture the DC world a bit more.
