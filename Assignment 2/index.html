    <h2>A Short Summary</h2>
    <h3>A Man Out Of Time</h3>
    <p>Alric was once a hero, but now lives in the distant future. 
      He's a man out of time, in a era that no longer needs savoirs. 
      He still holds onto the values of hope, faith, and compassion in 
      a society that grown numb and sterile.
      He is haunted by his own grief of his family, friends, and lost time. 
      Alric navigates a disconnected world, struggling to find meaning.
      This is a story about living between what was and what is, 
      about being good when goodness feel forgotten, and about a quiet man trying
      to heal in a world that moved on without him.
