  <h2>Why I Made This Character</h2>
  <p>I wanted to explore specific themes maybe identity, isolation, or resilience. 
    Sometimes creating a character helps me process ideas or emotions before I know how they fit into a larger story.</p>

  <h2>What's Interesting About Them</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>They have a complex past and internal conflict</li>
    <li>Their design is inspired by Vagabond, Comic Character Studies, and many more where I deep dive alot.</li>
    <li>I’m still discovering who they are, and that’s part of the fun</li>
  </ul>
